            <div>
                Lattice Semiconductor is the low power programmable leader. The company solves customer problems across the network, from the Edge to the Cloud, in the growing communications, computing, industrial, automotive and consumer markets. The tasks that were given to me include dashboard tracker, enhancing radiant online help software, and python scripting to automate images on their software application. The total number of hours rendered is 324 hours.

                Synthesis of the Pracitum Engagement

            <div>
                I learned a lot during my practicum. First, I got better at talking and working with my teammates, which helped me improve my people skills. I also realized that even if you already know how to do something, there's always more to learn. I picked up new tools like WebWorks ePublisher, Perforce, Linux and Unix systems, and Adobe Acrobat.

                I also saw how fast things move in the corporate world. When you're given a task, you're expected to do it right away. I try to, but sometimes I get delayed because it takes me a bit longer to learn new things. My dad once told me not to wait for instructions from my boss—he said I should take initiative and ask what I can do, even if no one told me yet. That advice really helped. It showed my supervisor that I wanted to help and be part of the team.

                There was one thing I didn't like, though. It took a long time to get access to the tools and accounts I needed, and that made me feel stressed since I had less time to finish my work. Still, I did my best, and this practicum taught me so much—about both work and myself.
