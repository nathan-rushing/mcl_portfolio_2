                    Data Analytics
                </div>
                <div>
                    Data analytics is my favorite field in computing because I enjoy turning numbers into clear and useful stories. At its core, data analysis means looking at data to find patterns, insights, and answers.

                <div>
                    I love creating dashboards and charts that help people understand data easily. I use different tools like Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, and Python to make my visualizations clear and helpful.

                <div>
                    I also know how to use SQL to get and manage data from databases, and I’m familiar with the ETL process (Extract, Transform, Load), which is used to prepare data for analysis. I understand how to clean data, transform it, and do exploratory data analysis (EDA) to see what the data tells us.

                <div>
                    I've been developing software for about four years, starting from my first year in college. I focus more on web development, but I also have some experience with mobile apps. I know how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build websites, and I've worked with frameworks like Bootstrap, Django, and Flask to make my projects better and faster to build.

                <div>
                    I've also worked with different databases like SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, so I know how to handle and manage data in my apps. In addition, I've used Weka for tasks like data mining and machine learning, and I've done computer vision projects using Python.

                    I've worked with several programming languages and tools that have helped me build various software projects. Python is my main language, which I use mostly for building web applications and more. I’ve also used C# before for developing applications, but Python is my main language. On the framework side, I’ve used Django REST Framework to develop strong and secure APIs, I use Bootstrap to design responsive layouts quickly. I also have the experience in Flask when I need lightweight and flexible web solutions.

                    When I started developing a web application, I used JavaScript to add interactive features to websites. And for the front end, I rely on HTML and CSS to create well-structured and nicely styled web pages.
